//very component we have is its own class
class StorePicker extends React.Component {
  // a class needs at least ONE method
  // one of the methods has to be 'render'
  // render determines what html or DOM elements are to be
  //   rendered to the page
  // clasName is used instad of class
  // to return multiple lines for html, place the code in
  //   parens, it'll follow the BEDMAS rule
  // From a render method you can only return ONE element
  //    you can't return sibling elements
  //    You can return many elements inside a parent element, 
  //    You just can't return sibling elements
  // The solution is to wrap them in a React.Fragment tag
  // This allows us to return as many adjacent elements as we want
  // Soon we may be to enclose the adj elements in empty opening and
  //    closing tags <></> *** Can use these now! 
  // commenting in JSX is different, need to use curly brackets
  //    and JS block comments

  //**** IMPORTANT YOU CANNOT return both a comment and an
  //   element-- if you need to have a comment you must put it inside
  //    of your returned element...it reads it as an adjacent
  //    jsx selector if not.
  // render() {
  //   return (
  //     <React.Fragment>
  //       <p>Fish!</p>
  //       <form action="" className="store-selector">
  //         {/* a comment in JSX */}
  //        <h2>Please Enter A Store</h2>
  //       </form> 
  //     </React.Fragment>
  //   )
  // }

  // the default action of a form is to take all the inputs that 
      //  have names and submit that data to either the action 
      // of the form - or subit it to the same page.
      // the form submitting is actually refreshing the page. 
      // If you're not using a server side form handler, and are handling
      // it right in JS,  
      // Pass the function the event, and call preventDefault 
      //    on the event to prevent the refresh default action
  
  // to bind our own methods to 'this'
  // the constructor function/ method, is a method that will run 
  //  before the StorePicker component is created.
  // 
  // constructor() {
  //   // can't run anything in constructor until you call super()
  //   // super() first runs the component that we're extending - React.component
  //   super();
  //   // in construtor we can bind all the methods
  //   // it will 'this' inside of goToStore as the StorePicker instance
  //   // if you don't bind it, 'this' in goToStore will be undefined
  //   this.goToStore = this.goToStore.bind(this);
  // } 

  // using the constructor() can get quite big if you have many methods,
  // a solution is instead of declaring a method on the component, we 
  //    instead declare a property - which is going to be set to an arrow 
  //    function.
  // *** properties will be bound to the instance rather than nothing.
  //      then we'll be able to access 'this' inside of it.
